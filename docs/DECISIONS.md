# Trakkly â€” Decision Log (ADR)

## ADR-0001: Architecture & Stack
- Status: Accepted
- Context: Mobile-only, offline-first, 0-cost.
- Decision: PWA with React + Vite + TypeScript + Tailwind; IndexedDB (Dexie) for storage; Workbox for PWA.
- Consequences: Fast iteration; later add sync via storage adapter; no native APIs beyond PWA.

## ADR-0002: Security & Encryption UX
- Status: Accepted
- Context: E2EE mandatory; user wants device unlock as app lock; passwordless acceptable.
- Decision: Default to device unlock (WebAuthn platform authenticator) to gate access to the master encryption key (hardware-bound). Provide passcode fallback (Argon2id -> AES-GCM master key). Auto-lock after inactivity (default 5 minutes) and on app background. Quick Unlock enabled by default where supported, with user toggle in Settings.
- Consequences: Strong UX with minimal friction; works offline; fallback covers devices lacking WebAuthn. Implementation complexity moderate.

## ADR-0003: Backend for MVP
- Status: Accepted
- Context: 0-cost, offline-first, <10s eventual consistency, mergeable increments.
- Decision: No backend in MVP. Do not use Google Apps Script/Sheets. Plan E2EE sync post-MVP using Firestore (or OSS alt) with event-log/CRDT.
- Consequences: Faster MVP; clean separation to add sync later.

## ADR-0004: Telemetry Policy
- Status: Accepted
- Context: Privacy-preserving analytics and crash reporting desired; opt-in.
- Decision: Integrate Sentry and PostHog providers behind feature flags; OFF by default; no PII; redact names by default.
- Consequences: Observability when opted-in; zero data sent otherwise.

## ADR-0005: Hosting & Environments
- Status: Accepted
- Context: 0-cost hosting and simple environments (dev/staging/prod).
- Decision: Host PWA on GitHub Pages. Use branches or environments for staging and prod. CI/CD with GitHub Actions.
- Consequences: Zero hosting cost; static deploys; no server required.

## ADR-0006: Provider/Adapter Architecture
- Status: Accepted
- Context: We will integrate multiple third-party providers (telemetry, sync, crypto, device unlock) over time and want easy swapping.
- Decision: Define TypeScript interfaces per concern and provide default no-op/local implementations. Use a React `AdaptersProvider` context to inject adapters app-wide and load env config from `src/config/env.ts`. Current adapters: `TelemetryAdapter` (Noop default), `SyncAdapter` (LocalOnly default), `CryptoEngine` (Placeholder), `DeviceUnlockAdapter` (Noop). Factories can later return Sentry/PostHog/Firestore etc.
- Consequences: Clear seams for future integrations; enables unit testing via adapter mocks; minimal initial complexity.
